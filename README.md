# RTOS Project – Real-Time Operating System Demo

This project showcases a basic real-time operating system (RTOS) implementation targeting embedded systems. It includes task management, scheduling, inter-task communication, and peripheral control using FreeRTOS or a custom lightweight RTOS kernel.

## 🚀 Features
- Preemptive and cooperative task scheduling
- Task creation, deletion, and priority handling
- Inter-task communication via queues, semaphores, and event groups
- Timer and delay management using hardware abstraction
- Peripheral demos (LED blink, UART, GPIO interrupt)
- Optional FreeRTOS integration for advanced real-time functionality
