# RTOS Project – Real-Time Operating System Demo

This project showcases a basic real-time operating system (RTOS) implementation targeting embedded systems. It includes task management, scheduling, inter-task communication, and peripheral control using FreeRTOS or a custom lightweight RTOS kernel.

## 🚀 Features
- Preemptive and cooperative task scheduling
- Task creation, deletion, and priority handling
- Inter-task communication via queues, semaphores, and event groups
- Timer and delay management using hardware abstraction
- Peripheral demos (LED blink, UART, GPIO interrupt)
- Optional FreeRTOS integration for advanced real-time functionality

## 📁 Structure

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Build using Makefile or CMake
3. Flash to a supported embedded board (e.g. STM32, LPC, ESP32)

## 📚 Requirements
- ARM-GCC or toolchain for your MCU
- Basic knowledge of embedded C/C++
- UART/USB debugger (optional)
